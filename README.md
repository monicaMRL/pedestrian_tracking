# pedestrian_tracking
This was the project I did under Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi

Abstract: The ability to track moving objects in a video made with a moving camera is a task that humans perform with remarkable ease and triviality (and they actually do so with two moving cameras, the eyes), yet as a problem for a computer vision system it turns out not to be so easy. This problem is characterised by a dual character of two independent motions. On the one hand, we have the movement of the moving camera (e.g., on a the robot) in the environment. On the other hand, we have the external motion of objects in the environment (e.g., pedestrians). This project deals with tracking pedestrian using a camera mounted on a mobile robot.
